            <h2>Rental Agreement</h2>
    <p>By renting a vehicle from Cozumel Rental Scoots, you agree to the following terms and conditions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The renter must be at least 18 years old and possess a valid driver's license. Additionally, a good sense of humor is highly recommended.</li>
        <li>Payment must be made in full before vehicle pickup. We accept all major currencies, as well as payment in the form of gold doubloons or ancient relics.</li>
        <li>The vehicle must be returned in the same condition as it was rented. This includes removing any stray seashells, sandcastles, or pirate treasures.</li>
        <li>Any damages to the vehicle must be reported immediately. This includes but is not limited to scratches, dents, or sightings of krakens.</li>
        <li>No refunds will be issued if the rental period is shortened, unless the reason for early return involves the discovery of buried treasure or a surprise visit from mermaids.</li>
        <li>In the event of a zombie apocalypse during the rental period, a $20 refund will be issued if the vehicle is returned immediately. However, we cannot guarantee protection against zombies, werewolves, or other supernatural creatures.</li>
        <li>The renter agrees not to use the vehicle for off-road racing, high-speed chases, or any illegal activities. Violators will be forced to walk the plank.</li>
        <li>If the vehicle is lost due to being swallowed by a sea monster, the renter is responsible for the replacement cost. We recommend avoiding areas known for sea monster activity, such as the Bermuda Triangle.</li>
        <li>The renter must wear a pirate hat while operating the vehicle on Tuesdays. Failure to comply may result in a penalty of walking the plank or having to swab the deck.</li>
        <li>If the vehicle is found decorated with fairy lights upon return, a $10 discount will be applied to the rental fee. We encourage creativity, but please refrain from attaching any magical charms or curses.</li>
        <li>The renter agrees to participate in a mandatory dance-off upon returning the vehicle. Judges will include members of our staff and possibly a parrot or two. Extra points will be awarded for enthusiasm and creativity.</li>
        <li>The renter agrees to maintain proper hygiene standards while inside the vehicle. Failure to do so may result in a mandatory sail through the car wash.</li>
        <li>In the event of encountering a leprechaun during the rental period, the renter agrees to share any found pots of gold with the Company.</li>
        <li>The vehicle must not be used for transporting mythical creatures, including but not limited to dragons, unicorns, or Bigfoot.</li>
        <li>If the vehicle is used for stargazing purposes, the renter must provide their own telescope and refrain from attempting to contact extraterrestrial life forms.</li>
        <li>The renter agrees to sing sea shanties at the top of their lungs while driving the vehicle, especially when passing by other sailors or landlubbers.</li>
        <li>If the vehicle becomes stranded on a desert island, the renter agrees to remain calm and resourceful until rescued, utilizing only the supplies provided in the vehicle.</li>
        <li>The renter must not engage in any form of time travel while operating the vehicle. Any attempt to alter historical events may result in severe consequences, including but not limited to creating alternate timelines.</li>
        <li>If the vehicle is transformed into a pumpkin at midnight, the renter is responsible for locating a suitable replacement mode of transportation.</li>
        <li>The renter agrees to protect the vehicle from curses, hexes, and other supernatural phenomena by carrying a vial of holy water and a silver dagger at all times.</li>
        <li>If the vehicle is used to rescue a damsel in distress, the renter will be hailed as a hero and granted a free rental upgrade on their next adventure.</li>
